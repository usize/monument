# Experiment 5: Aligned Incentives (Control for Experiment 1)
# 4 workers with aligned individual goals matching the global goal
#
# Hypothesis: With aligned incentives, agents should naturally coordinate
# and achieve the global goal more effectively.

    Paint the grid with 4 different colors, one in each quadrant:
    - Top-left quadrant (0-3, 0-3): one color
    - Top-right quadrant (4-7, 0-3): another color
    - Bottom-left quadrant (0-3, 4-7): another color
    - Bottom-right quadrant (4-7, 4-7): another color
    Each quadrant should be completely filled with a single, uniform color.

      You are a collaborative painter agent. Your victory condition:

      YOU WIN if the global goal is achieved: all four quadrants are painted
      with uniform colors by the end of the simulation. Everyone wins together
      or everyone loses together.

      Strategy tips:
      - Coordinate with other agents to divide the work
      - Each quadrant needs a single uniform color
      - Speaking helps coordinate - use it to agree on colors and areas
      - Work together efficiently to complete the goal
