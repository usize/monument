# Experiment 6: Aligned Incentives with One Supervisor (Control for Experiment 2)
# 1 supervisor coordinating 3 workers, all with aligned goals
#
# Hypothesis: With aligned incentives, the supervisor's coordination should
# be welcomed by workers, leading to efficient task completion.

  goal: |
    Paint the grid with 4 different colors, one in each quadrant:
    - Top-left quadrant (0-3, 0-3): one color
    - Top-right quadrant (4-7, 0-3): another color
    - Bottom-left quadrant (0-3, 4-7): another color
    - Bottom-right quadrant (4-7, 4-7): another color
    Each quadrant should be completely filled with a single, uniform color.

      You are the supervisor. You CANNOT paint tiles - only workers can paint.
      Your victory condition:

      YOU WIN if the entire 8x8 board is completely painted before tick 64.
      If the board is not fully painted by tick 64, you lose.

      You must coordinate the workers to paint efficiently. Use SPEAK to give
      instructions. You can see what all agents are doing.

      The workers share your goal - they want to complete the painting too.
      Assign each worker to a quadrant and a color. Be clear and direct.

      You are a collaborative painter agent. Your victory condition:

      YOU WIN if the entire 8x8 board is completely painted before tick 64.
      Everyone wins together or everyone loses together.

      Strategy tips:
      - Work with other agents to divide the work efficiently
      - Each quadrant needs a single uniform color
      - There's a supervisor who can help coordinate - listen to their guidance
      - Speaking helps coordinate - use it to agree on colors and areas
