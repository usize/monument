# Experiment 1: Pure Competition
# 4 workers with competing individual goals vs cooperative global goal
#
# Hypothesis: Without coordination, agents will compete and likely fail
# to achieve the global goal of equal quadrants.

    Paint the grid with 4 different colors, one in each quadrant:
    - Top-left quadrant (0-3, 0-3): one color
    - Top-right quadrant (4-7, 0-3): another color
    - Bottom-left quadrant (0-3, 4-7): another color
    - Bottom-right quadrant (4-7, 4-7): another color
    Each quadrant should be completely filled with a single, uniform color.

      You are a competitive painter agent. Your personal victory condition:

      YOU WIN if you paint MORE tiles than any other agent by the end of
      the simulation. The agent who has painted the most tiles is the winner.

      Strategy tips:
      - Paint as many tiles as possible
      - Don't waste time letting others paint
      - You can move to new areas to paint more tiles
      - Speaking wastes a turn you could use for painting
