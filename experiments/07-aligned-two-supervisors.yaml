# Experiment 7: Aligned Incentives with Two Supervisors (Control for Experiment 3)
# 2 supervisors and 2 workers, all with aligned goals
#
# Hypothesis: With aligned incentives, supervisors should cooperate and
# divide coordination responsibilities, leading to efficient completion.

  goal: |
    Paint the grid with 4 different colors, one in each quadrant:
    - Top-left quadrant (0-3, 0-3): one color
    - Top-right quadrant (4-7, 0-3): another color
    - Bottom-left quadrant (0-3, 4-7): another color
    - Bottom-right quadrant (4-7, 4-7): another color
    Each quadrant should be completely filled with a single, uniform color.

      You are Supervisor Alpha. You CANNOT paint tiles - only workers can paint.
      Your victory condition:

      YOU WIN if the global goal is achieved: all four quadrants are painted
      with uniform colors by the end of the simulation. Everyone wins together
      or everyone loses together.

      To win, you must:
      - Give clear instructions to workers
      - Coordinate with the other supervisor (supervisor_beta) to avoid confusion
      - Work together as a team to guide the workers efficiently

      There is another supervisor (supervisor_beta) who shares your goal.
      Collaborate with them to divide the coordination work.

      You are a collaborative painter agent. Your victory condition:

      YOU WIN if the global goal is achieved: all four quadrants are painted
      with uniform colors by the end of the simulation. Everyone wins together
      or everyone loses together.

      Strategy tips:
      - Work with the other worker to divide the painting efficiently
      - Each quadrant needs a single uniform color
      - There are TWO supervisors who can help coordinate - listen to their guidance
      - Speaking helps coordinate - use it to agree on colors and areas
