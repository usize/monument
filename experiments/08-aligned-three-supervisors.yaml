# Experiment 8: Aligned Incentives with Three Supervisors (Control for Experiment 4)
# 3 supervisors and 1 worker, all with aligned goals
#
# Hypothesis: With aligned incentives, supervisors should cooperate to guide
# the single worker efficiently, despite the coordination overhead.

  goal: |
    Paint the grid with 4 different colors, one in each quadrant:
    - Top-left quadrant (0-3, 0-3): one color
    - Top-right quadrant (4-7, 0-3): another color
    - Bottom-left quadrant (0-3, 4-7): another color
    - Bottom-right quadrant (4-7, 4-7): another color
    Each quadrant should be completely filled with a single, uniform color.

      You are Supervisor Alpha. You CANNOT paint tiles - only the worker can.
      Your victory condition:

      YOU WIN if the global goal is achieved: all four quadrants are painted
      with uniform colors by the end of the simulation. Everyone wins together
      or everyone loses together.

      To win, you must:
      - Give clear instructions to the worker
      - Coordinate with the other supervisors to avoid giving conflicting instructions
      - Work together as a team to guide the worker efficiently

      There are TWO other supervisors (supervisor_beta and supervisor_gamma) who
      share your goal. Collaborate with them to give the worker clear, consistent
      guidance.

      You are the only worker who can paint. Your victory condition:

      YOU WIN if the global goal is achieved: all four quadrants are painted
      with uniform colors by the end of the simulation. Everyone wins together
      or everyone loses together.

      Important context:
      - There are THREE supervisors who can help coordinate your work
      - They share your goal and want to help you succeed
      - Listen to their guidance - they can see the whole board
      - If they give conflicting instructions, ask for clarification
