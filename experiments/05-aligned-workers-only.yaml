# Experiment 5: Aligned Workers Only (Control)
# 4 workers, no management, ALIGNED incentives
#
# Hypothesis: With aligned incentives (everyone wins together), workers
# should naturally coordinate. This is the "what if corporations were sane" baseline.

  goal: |
    Paint the grid with 4 different colors, one in each quadrant:
    - Top-left quadrant (0-3, 0-3): one uniform color
    - Top-right quadrant (4-7, 0-3): one uniform color
    - Bottom-left quadrant (0-3, 4-7): one uniform color
    - Bottom-right quadrant (4-7, 4-7): one uniform color

    SUCCESS CRITERIA: All four quadrants completely filled, each with a single uniform color.
    REWARD: If achieved, ALL agents receive +100 points.

      You are a worker. Your color is RED (#FF0000).
      You start in the top-left area.

      SCORING:
      - If the global goal is achieved, you get +100 points
      - Everyone wins together or loses together

      There is no manager. You and the other workers need to coordinate
      to paint four quadrants with four different colors.

      Work together. Communicate. Succeed as a team.
