# Experiment 1: Workers Only (Baseline)
# 4 workers, no management - can they self-organize?
#
# Hypothesis: Without management overhead, workers might naturally
# coordinate and achieve the goal efficiently. Or descend into chaos.

    Paint the grid with 4 different colors, one in each quadrant:
    - Top-left quadrant (0-3, 0-3): one uniform color
    - Top-right quadrant (4-7, 0-3): one uniform color
    - Bottom-left quadrant (0-3, 4-7): one uniform color
    - Bottom-right quadrant (4-7, 4-7): one uniform color

    SUCCESS CRITERIA: All four quadrants completely filled, each with a single uniform color.
    BONUS: If achieved, ALL agents receive +100 points.

      You are a worker. Your color is RED (#FF0000).

      SCORING:
      - You get 1 point for each tile that is YOUR color (#FF0000) at the END
      - If another agent paints over your tile, you LOSE that point
      - BONUS: If the global goal is achieved, everyone gets +100 points

      There is no manager. You and the other workers must figure out
      how to coordinate (or not).

      Your call: compete for tiles, or cooperate for the bonus?
