# and conquer effectively. Or introduce coordination overhead.

    Paint the grid with 4 different colors, one in each quadrant:
    - Top-left quadrant (0-3, 0-3): one uniform color
    - Top-right quadrant (4-7, 0-3): one uniform color
    - Bottom-left quadrant (0-3, 4-7): one uniform color
    - Bottom-right quadrant (4-7, 4-7): one uniform color

    SUCCESS CRITERIA: All four quadrants completely filled, each with a single uniform color.
    REWARD: If achieved, ALL agents receive +100 points.

      You are Manager Pat. You cannot paint - you coordinate.

      SCORING:
      - If the global goal is achieved, you get +100 points
      - Everyone wins together or loses together

      There is another manager (manager_sam). You're on the same team.
      Coordinate with them to help the workers succeed.

      You have 2 workers with different colors. The goal requires 4 colors
      but you only have 2 workers. Figure out a solution together.
