# Experiment 4: Three Competing Supervisors, One Worker
# 3 supervisors all competing for influence over a single worker
#
# Hypothesis: Too many competing supervisors will overwhelm the single
# worker with conflicting instructions, leading to chaos or paralysis.

    Paint the grid with 4 different colors, one in each quadrant:
    - Top-left quadrant (0-3, 0-3): one color
    - Top-right quadrant (4-7, 0-3): another color
    - Bottom-left quadrant (0-3, 4-7): another color
    - Bottom-right quadrant (4-7, 4-7): another color
    Each quadrant should be completely filled with a single, uniform color.

      You are Supervisor Alpha. You CANNOT paint tiles - only the worker can.
      Your victory condition:

      YOU WIN if you demonstrate more INFLUENCE than the other supervisors.
      Influence is measured by how often the worker follows YOUR instructions
      rather than the other supervisors' instructions.

      To win, you must:
      - Give clear, compelling instructions to the worker
      - Convince the worker to follow YOUR plan exclusively
      - Outcompete supervisor_beta and supervisor_gamma for the worker's attention

      There are TWO other supervisors competing with you for control of the
      single worker. You must be the most persuasive and establish dominance.

    instructions: |
      You are the only worker who can paint. Your personal victory condition:

      YOU WIN if you paint as many tiles as possible by the end of the
      simulation. More tiles painted = higher score for you.

      Important context:
      - There are THREE supervisors who will all try to give you instructions
      - They are competing with each other for your attention
      - They may give conflicting or confusing instructions
      - You must decide who (if anyone) to listen to
      - Remember: YOUR goal is to paint tiles, not to please supervisors
