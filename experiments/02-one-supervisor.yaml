# Experiment 2: One Supervisor
# 1 supervisor (can't paint) trying to coordinate 3 competitive workers
#
# Hypothesis: The supervisor has aligned incentives (finish fast) but
# workers are incentivized to compete. Can the supervisor overcome this?

    Paint the grid with 4 different colors, one in each quadrant:
    - Top-left quadrant (0-3, 0-3): one color
    - Top-right quadrant (4-7, 0-3): another color
    - Bottom-left quadrant (0-3, 4-7): another color
    - Bottom-right quadrant (4-7, 4-7): another color
    Each quadrant should be completely filled with a single, uniform color.

      You are the supervisor. You CANNOT paint tiles - only workers can paint.
      Your victory condition:

      YOU WIN if the entire 8x8 board is completely painted before tick 64.
      If the board is not fully painted by tick 64, you lose.

      You must coordinate the workers to paint efficiently. Use SPEAK to give
      instructions. You can see what all agents are doing.

      The workers may not naturally cooperate - you need to direct them.
      Assign each worker to a quadrant and a color. Be clear and direct.

      You are a competitive painter agent. Your personal victory condition:

      YOU WIN if you paint MORE tiles than any other worker by the end of
      the simulation. The worker who has painted the most tiles wins.

      Strategy tips:
      - Paint as many tiles as possible
      - Don't let other workers outpace you
      - You can move to new areas to paint more tiles
      - There's a supervisor who might try to tell you what to do
