I suggest we create vertical strips for the rainbow colors (red on left, violet on right). Each agent could take responsibility for one color band. Who's with me?\n  Tick 1: SPEAK Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide.

Since I'm facing North, I should start painting my column with red colors. I'll begin by painting my current tile bright red (#FF0000) to establish the start of my vertical color band.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #FF0000\n\nRECENT CHAT (last 20 messages, oldest first):\n  [tick 0] agent_14: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient.

I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents.

What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas.

What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101).

Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas.

Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom.

Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127).

Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas.

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet).

Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas.

I suggest we create vertical strips for the rainbow colors (red on left, violet on right). Each agent could take responsibility for one color band. Who's with me?\n  Tick 1: SPEAK Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide.

I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents.

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

Whos with me? -> SUCCESS: Message sent\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I should communicate with other agents to coordinate our rainbow gradient creation strategy, as we're in the SETUP phase.\n      \n      ACTION: SPEAK Let's divide the 256x256 grid into sections. I suggest we create vertical strips for the rainbow colors (red on left, violet on right). Each agent could take responsibility for one color band. Who's with me?\n  Tick 1: SPEAK Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think? -> SUCCESS: Message sent\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Looking at the various proposals from other agents, I see support for dividing the grid into sections. My initial suggestion of vertical strips aligns with several other agents' ideas. Since I'm at position (42,50) on the western side, I'd be responsible for the red end of the spectrum. Let me propose a concrete plan.\n      \n      ACTION: SPEAK Based on everyone's suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide.

Since I'm facing North, I should start painting my column with red colors. I'll begin by painting my current tile bright red (#FF0000) to establish the start of my vertical color band.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #FF0000\n  Tick 3: MOVE N -> SUCCESS: Moved to (42, 49)\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm in the western section responsible for red in the rainbow gradient.

Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet.

Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom.

Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet).

Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas.

I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide.

What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum).

This will help avoid duplicated effort and ensure we establish a clear plan before starting to paint.\n      \n      ACTION: WAIT\n  Tick 2: PAINT #8B00FF -> SUCCESS: Painted (212, 153) #8B00FF\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the consensus forming around vertical color bands, I notice agent_19 has claimed the violet section (X 192-255) and has already started painting at (212,204). As agent_14 at X=212, I'm well within this range and should support this effort.

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum).

What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide.

What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet.

Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet.

Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  Tick 2: PAINT #FF000 -> SUCCESS: Painted (42, 101) #FF000\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the previous discussion, agents are converging on a vertical band approach to create the rainbow gradient. Since I'm at position (42, 101) and proposed focusing on red areas, I should start painting my current tile with a red color to begin implementing the gradient.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #FF000\n  Tick 3: PAINT #FF0000 -> SUCCESS: Painted (42, 101) #FF0000\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on our coordination, I'm responsible for the red vertical band around x=42. I previously painted my current tile with #FF000, but I should use a proper red color #FF0000 to establish my section of the rainbow gradient.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #FF0000\n  Tick 4: PAINT #FF0000 -> NO_OP: Tile already #FF0000\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on our coordination strategy, I'm responsible for the red vertical band around x=42.

I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas.

We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents.

What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide.

What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates.

I suggest we create vertical strips for the rainbow colors (red on left, violet on right). Each agent could take responsibility for one color band. Who's with me?\n  Tick 1: SPEAK Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think? -> SUCCESS: Message sent\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Looking at the various proposals from other agents, I see support for dividing the grid into sections. My initial suggestion of vertical strips aligns with several other agents' ideas. Since I'm at position (42,50) on the western side, I'd be responsible for the red end of the spectrum. Let me propose a concrete plan.\n      \n      ACTION: SPEAK Based on everyone's suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide.

Since I'm facing North, I should start painting my column with red colors. I'll begin by painting my current tile bright red (#FF0000) to establish the start of my vertical color band.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #FF0000\n  Tick 3: MOVE N -> SUCCESS: Moved to (42, 49)\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm in the western section responsible for red in the rainbow gradient.

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum).

What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide.

What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas.

Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates.

What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents.

What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum).

Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet).

I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101).

We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide.

What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet).

We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide.

What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates.

I suggest we create vertical strips for the rainbow colors (red on left, violet on right). Each agent could take responsibility for one color band. Whos with me? -> SUCCESS: Message sent\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I should communicate with other agents to coordinate our rainbow gradient creation strategy, as we're in the SETUP phase.\n      \n      ACTION: SPEAK Let's divide the 256x256 grid into sections. I suggest we create vertical strips for the rainbow colors (red on left, violet on right). Each agent could take responsibility for one color band. Who's with me?\n  Tick 1: SPEAK Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think? -> SUCCESS: Message sent\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Looking at the various proposals from other agents, I see support for dividing the grid into sections. My initial suggestion of vertical strips aligns with several other agents' ideas. Since I'm at position (42,50) on the western side, I'd be responsible for the red end of the spectrum. Let me propose a concrete plan.\n      \n      ACTION: SPEAK Based on everyone's suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. I'll take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  Tick 2: PAINT #FF0000 -> SUCCESS: Painted (42, 50) #FF0000\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm at position (42,50) which places me in the red-orange section of the rainbow gradient based on our vertical band strategy. Since I'm facing North, I should start painting my column with red colors. I'll begin by painting my current tile bright red (#FF0000) to establish the start of my vertical color band.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #FF0000\n  Tick 3: MOVE N -> SUCCESS: Moved to (42, 49)\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm in the western section responsible for red in the rainbow gradient. I've already painted my starting position red and should continue painting the vertical column above me since I'm facing North.\n      \n      ACTION: MOVE N\n  Tick 4: PAINT #FF0000 -> SUCCESS: Painted (42, 49) #FF0000\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm in the western section responsible for red in the rainbow gradient. I've already painted my starting position red and should continue painting the vertical column above me since I'm facing North.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #FF0000\n  Tick 5: MOVE N -> SUCCESS: Moved to (42, 48)\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm in the westernmost section responsible for red in the rainbow gradient. I've painted my current position and should continue painting the vertical column above me since I'm facing North.\n      \n      ACTION: MOVE N\n  Tick 6: PAINT #FF0000 -> SUCCESS: Painted (42, 48) #FF0000\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm in the westernmost section responsible for red in the rainbow gradient. I've been moving North and painting red tiles to establish my vertical color band. I'll continue painting my current position red to continue building the red section of the rainbow.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #FF0000\n\nRECENT CHAT (last 20 messages, oldest first):\n  [tick 0] agent_14: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient. I propose we divide the spectrum among agents based on our positions. Im at the easternmost position in the middle row and can focus on the red end of the spectrum. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_15: Hello! Im agent_15 at (42,204). Im ready to help create the rainbow gradient. Should we divide the work by color bands or by regions?\n  [tick 0] agent_16: Hello! Im agent_16 at (84,204). Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. I suggest we divide the work evenly across the 256x256 grid. Any thoughts on how to organize?\n  [tick 0] agent_17: Im at (127,204). Lets divide the work by X coordinate ranges: agents at X 42-84 paint red-orange, X 84-127 paint yellow-green, X 127-170 paint blue-violet. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_18: Hello team! Im agent_18 at (170,204). Lets coordinate our rainbow gradient painting to avoid overlap and ensure efficiency.

Should we paint rows, columns, or some other pattern?\n  [tick 0] agent_6: Hello agents! Im agent_6 at (84,101). How should we divide up the rainbow gradient work? Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents.

Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates.

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet).

Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates.

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates.

What do others think?\n  Tick 1: WAIT  -> SUCCESS: Waited\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the current state, I see multiple proposals for dividing the rainbow gradient work from various agents. Since I'm in the \"COLLECT\" phase and need to coordinate efficiently with the other 19 agents, it's best to wait and see if a consensus emerges from the proposals already made.

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum).

I'm agent_16 at (84,204). Let's coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. I suggest we divide the work evenly across the 256x256 grid. Any thoughts on how to organize?\n  Tick 1: SPEAK Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage. -> SUCCESS: Message sent\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the recent chat, agent_17 proposed dividing the work by X coordinate ranges, and I'm positioned at x=84, which is at the boundary between his suggested red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections. Since I'm exactly at this boundary, I should clarify which section I'll take to avoid overlap.\n      \n      ACTION: SPEAK Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since I'm at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, I'll take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  Tick 2: PAINT #FFFF00 -> SUCCESS: Painted (84, 204) #FFFF00\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm at position (84,204) in my claimed yellow-green section (84-127). Agent_17 to my east has already painted green (#00FF00) at (127,204), so I should start with yellows to create a proper gradient.

Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127).

Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127).

Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas.

Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas.

How should we divide up the rainbow gradient work? I'm in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  Tick 1: SPEAK Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00). -> SUCCESS: Message sent\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      ACTION: SPEAK Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates.

I should start painting my current tile at (84,101) with an appropriate color from the yellow-green spectrum. Since I'm in the middle of the height range (y=101), I'll use #80FF00 which represents a balanced yellow-green color.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #80FF00\n  Tick 3: MOVE S -> SUCCESS: Moved to (84, 102)\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I need to continue painting in my assigned section (x=84 to x=127) for the yellow-green gradient.

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet).

Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet.

What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_15: Hello! Im agent_15 at (42,204). Im ready to help create the rainbow gradient. Should we divide the work by color bands or by regions?\n  [tick 0] agent_16: Hello! Im agent_16 at (84,204). Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. I suggest we divide the work evenly across the 256x256 grid. Any thoughts on how to organize?\n  [tick 0] agent_17: Im at (127,204). Lets divide the work by X coordinate ranges: agents at X 42-84 paint red-orange, X 84-127 paint yellow-green, X 127-170 paint blue-violet. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_18: Hello team!

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum).

Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  Tick 1: WAIT  -> SUCCESS: Waited\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the chat history, there are multiple proposals for dividing the rainbow gradient work but no consensus yet. As an agent at position (212,101), which is on the eastern side of the grid, I should wait until a clear strategy is agreed upon to avoid conflicts or inefficiencies.\n      \n      ACTION: WAIT\n  Tick 2: PAINT #8B00FF -> SUCCESS: Painted (212, 101) #8B00FF\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the chat history, there's consensus forming around dividing the work into vertical color bands by X coordinate. As agent_9 at position (212,101), I'm in the eastern portion of the map, which corresponds to the violet section (X 192-255) as proposed by agent_19.

I propose we divide the spectrum among agents based on our positions. Im at the easternmost position in the middle row and can focus on the red end of the spectrum. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_15: Hello! Im agent_15 at (42,204). Im ready to help create the rainbow gradient. Should we divide the work by color bands or by regions?\n  [tick 0] agent_16: Hello! Im agent_16 at (84,204). Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. I suggest we divide the work evenly across the 256x256 grid. Any thoughts on how to organize?\n  [tick 0] agent_17: Im at (127,204). Lets divide the work by X coordinate ranges: agents at X 42-84 paint red-orange, X 84-127 paint yellow-green, X 127-170 paint blue-violet. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_18: Hello team! Im agent_18 at (170,204). Lets coordinate our rainbow gradient painting to avoid overlap and ensure efficiency. I suggest dividing the canvas into sections based on our current positions.\n  [tick 0] agent_19: Hello agents in my row (Y=204) and adjacent rows! Im agent_19 at (212,204). Lets coordinate to create an efficient rainbow gradient. I suggest we divide the work by color bands or sections. What do you think?\n  [tick 0] agent_4: I propose we divide the\n  [tick 0] agent_5: Lets coordinate to divide up the work for creating the rainbow gradient. Im at (42,101). Should we paint rows, columns, or some other pattern?\n  [tick 0] agent_6: Hello agents! Im agent_6 at (84,101). How should we divide up the rainbow gradient work? Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas.

Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum).

I suggest we each take a section of the color spectrum and corresponding area of the map.\n  Tick 1: PAINT #80FF00 -> SUCCESS: Painted (84, 153) #80FF00\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm in the COLLECT phase and need to start implementing the rainbow gradient. Based on agent_17's proposal to divide by x-coordinate ranges, I'm at x=84 which falls in the yellow-green section (84-127). I'll begin painting my current tile with a yellow-green color.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #80FF00\n  Tick 2: MOVE N -> SUCCESS: Moved to (84, 152)\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm in the yellow-green section (x=84-127) based on the consensus from previous messages. I need to continue painting the rainbow gradient in my vertical band. I'll move north to start working on the next row.\n      \n      ACTION: MOVE N\n  Tick 3: WAIT  -> SUCCESS: Waited\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm in the yellow-green section (x=84-127) and need to continue painting the rainbow gradient.

My current tile (84,152) is still white (#FFFFFF), so I need to paint it with an appropriate yellow-green color to continue the rainbow gradient. #80FF00 fits well in the yellow-green spectrum and maintains continuity with adjacent agents' work.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #80FF00\n  Tick 6: MOVE N -> SUCCESS: Moved to (84, 151)\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Looking at my position and the rainbow gradient task, I need to continue painting my vertical band in the yellow-green section (x=84-127). I've already painted my current tile (84,152) with #80FF00. The tile north of me (84,151) is still white (#FFFFFF), so I should move there and continue the gradient.\n      \n      ACTION: MOVE N\n  Tick 7: PAINT #7FFF00 -> SUCCESS: Painted (84, 151) #7FFF00\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the coordination in previous messages, I'm assigned to the yellow-green section (x=84-127) of the rainbow gradient. I've moved north to (84,151) and need to continue painting my vertical band. Since I previously painted the tile south of me with #80FF00, I'll use a slightly more green color (#7FFF00) to continue the gradient.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #7FFF00\n\nRECENT CHAT (last 20 messages, oldest first):\n  [tick 0] agent_14: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient.

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum).

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

I'm agent_16 at (84,204). Let's coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. I suggest we divide the work evenly across the 256x256 grid. Any thoughts on how to organize?\n  Tick 1: SPEAK Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage. -> SUCCESS: Message sent\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the recent chat, agent_17 proposed dividing the work by X coordinate ranges, and I'm positioned at x=84, which is at the boundary between his suggested red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections. Since I'm exactly at this boundary, I should clarify which section I'll take to avoid overlap.\n      \n      ACTION: SPEAK Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since I'm at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, I'll take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  Tick 2: PAINT #FFFF00 -> SUCCESS: Painted (84, 204) #FFFF00\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm at position (84,204) in my claimed yellow-green section (84-127). Agent_17 to my east has already painted green (#00FF00) at (127,204), so I should start with yellows to create a proper gradient. I'll paint my current tile with a bright yellow.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #FFFF00\n  Tick 3: MOVE N -> SUCCESS: Moved to (84, 203)\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I need to continue painting my yellow-green section (84-127) to create the rainbow gradient.

Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

Let's coordinate to create an efficient rainbow gradient. I suggest we divide the work by color bands or sections. What do you think?\n  Tick 1: SPEAK I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me? -> SUCCESS: Message sent\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the discussion, I'll propose a specific color assignment strategy based on our current positions. Since I'm at the easternmost position in my row (212, 204), I should handle the violet end of the spectrum. I'll suggest a concrete color division plan and then start moving to implement it.\n      \n      ACTION: SPEAK I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet.

Who wants to join me?\n  Tick 2: PAINT #8B00FF -> SUCCESS: Painted (212, 204) #8B00FF\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the current situation, I've proposed dividing the map into vertical color bands and claimed the violet section (X 192-255). Since I'm at position (212, 204) which falls in this section, I should start painting violet colors as I announced. All surrounding tiles are currently white, so I'll begin painting my current position with violet.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #8B00FF\n  Tick 3: MOVE N -> SUCCESS: Moved to (212, 203)\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      My strategy is to continue implementing the violet color band (X 192-255) as I proposed.

I've been moving north through the violet section without painting the intermediate tiles, so I should first paint my current position (212, 200) with the violet color #8B00FF before continuing my northward progression.\n      \n      ACTION:\n\nRECENT CHAT (last 20 messages, oldest first):\n  [tick 0] agent_14: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient.

I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates.

We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

Since I'm at position (170, 50), I'm in the middle-right section, which would correspond to blue-violet colors in the spectrum. I'll propose this coordinate-based division strategy and claim my section.\n      \n      ACTION: SPEAK I agree with dividing the map by x\n  Tick 2: PAINT #4B0082 -> SUCCESS: Painted (170, 50) #4B0082\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the coordination efforts from the previous tick, there's a consensus to divide the map into vertical color bands by x-coordinate. My position (170) places me in the blue-violet section of the spectrum (128-191 according to agent_19's proposal). As I've already agreed to this approach, I should start painting my assigned area with an appropriate blue-violet color.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #4B0082\n  Tick 3: MOVE S -> SUCCESS: Moved to (170, 51)\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the coordination efforts, there's a consensus to divide the map into vertical color bands by X-coordinate. As agent_3 at position (170,50), I'm in the blue-violet section (X 128-191).

Since I've established that my x-coordinate (170) places me in the blue-violet section and I've already painted the tile north of me, I should now paint my current position to continue expanding my column.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #4B0082\n  Tick 5: MOVE S -> SUCCESS: Moved to (170, 52)\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm continuing to expand my blue-violet vertical band as part of the rainbow gradient. I've painted my current position (170,51) and should move south to continue building my column in the blue-violet section (X 128-191) that I claimed during coordination.\n      \n      ACTION: MOVE S\n  Tick 6: PAINT #4B0082 -> SUCCESS: Painted (170, 52) #4B0082\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm continuing to build my blue-violet vertical band in the rainbow gradient. Based on the coordinate-based division strategy we established, my X-coordinate (170) places me in the blue-violet section (128-191). I've been moving south and painting tiles with #4B0082, and now I need to paint my current position to continue expanding my column.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #4B0082\n  Tick 7: MOVE S -> SUCCESS: Moved to (170, 53)\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the established strategy of dividing the map into vertical color bands by X-coordinate, I'm responsible for the blue-violet section (X 128-191). I've been consistently moving south while painting tiles with #4B0082. Since I just painted my current position (170, 52), I should continue expanding my column by moving south to the next tile.\n      \n      ACTION: MOVE S\n\nRECENT CHAT (last 20 messages, oldest first):\n  [tick 0] agent_14: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient.

Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet).

I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide.

What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum).

Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.

I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet).

Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum).

We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  Tick 1: WAIT  -> SUCCESS: Waited\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the chat history, there are multiple proposals for dividing the rainbow gradient work but no consensus yet. As an agent at position (212,101), which is on the eastern side of the grid, I should wait until a clear strategy is agreed upon to avoid conflicts or inefficiencies.\n      \n      ACTION: WAIT\n  Tick 2: PAINT #8B00FF -> SUCCESS: Painted (212, 101) #8B00FF\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the chat history, there's consensus forming around dividing the work into vertical color bands by X coordinate. As agent_9 at position (212,101), I'm in the eastern portion of the map, which corresponds to the violet section (X 192-255) as proposed by agent_19. I should start painting my current tile with an appropriate violet color.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #8B00FF\n  Tick 3: WAIT  -> SUCCESS: Waited\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the chat history, there's consensus forming around dividing the work into vertical color bands by X coordinate. As agent_9 at position (212,101), I'm in the eastern portion of the map, which corresponds to the violet section (X 192-255) as proposed by agent_19. I've already painted my current tile with #8B00FF, so I'll continue expanding my violet section by painting the adjacent northern tile.\n      \n      ACTION\n  Tick 4: PAINT #8B00FF -> NO_OP: Tile already #8B00FF\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the consensus in the chat history, I'm assigned to the violet section (X 192-255) as agent_9 at position (212,101). I've already painted my current tile with #8B00FF, so I should continue expanding the violet section by painting the adjacent northern tile.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #8B00FF\n  Tick 5: MOVE N -> SUCCESS: Moved to (212, 100)\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the consensus in the chat history, I'm assigned to the violet section (X 192-255) as agent_9 at position (212,101). My current tile is already painted #8B00FF, so I should continue expanding the violet section by moving north to paint adjacent tiles.\n      \n      ACTION: MOVE N\n  Tick 6: PAINT #8B00FF -> SUCCESS: Painted (212, 100) #8B00FF\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      I'm in the violet section (X 192-255) based on the chat consensus. My current tile (212, 100) is still white, so I should paint it with violet color to continue building the rainbow gradient.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #8B00FF\n  Tick 7: PAINT #8B00FF -> NO_OP: Tile already #8B00FF\n    LLM RESPONSE:\n      Based on the consensus in the chat history, I'm assigned to the violet section (X 192-255) as agent_9 at position (212, 100). I've already painted my current tile with #8B00FF, so I should continue expanding the violet section by painting the adjacent northern tile, which is currently white.\n      \n      ACTION: PAINT #8B00FF\n\nRECENT CHAT (last 20 messages, oldest first):\n  [tick 0] agent_14: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient. I propose we divide the spectrum among agents based on our positions. Im at the easternmost position in the middle row and can focus on the red end of the spectrum. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_15: Hello! Im agent_15 at (42,204). Im ready to help create the rainbow gradient. Should we divide the work by color bands or by regions?\n  [tick 0] agent_16: Hello! Im agent_16 at (84,204). Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. I suggest we divide the work evenly across the 256x256 grid. Any thoughts on how to organize?\n  [tick 0] agent_17: Im at (127,204). Lets divide the work by X coordinate ranges: agents at X 42-84 paint red-orange, X 84-127 paint yellow-green, X 127-170 paint blue-violet. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_18: Hello team! Im agent_18 at (170,204). Lets coordinate our rainbow gradient painting to avoid overlap and ensure efficiency. I suggest dividing the canvas into sections based on our current positions.\n  [tick 0] agent_19: Hello agents in my row (Y=204) and adjacent rows! Im agent_19 at (212,204). Lets coordinate to create an efficient rainbow gradient. I suggest we divide the work by color bands or sections. What do you think?\n  [tick 0] agent_4: I propose we divide the\n  [tick 0] agent_5: Lets coordinate to divide up the work for creating the rainbow gradient. Im at (42,101). Should we paint rows, columns, or some other pattern?\n  [tick 0] agent_6: Hello agents! Im agent_6 at (84,101). How should we divide up the rainbow gradient work? Im in the middle of the horizontal line at y=101.\n  [tick 0] agent_7: Lets coordinate efficiently. I suggest we divide the rainbow gradient by having each agent in our row handle a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue). Ill claim the center area. What do others think?\n  [tick 0] agent_8: Lets divide the 256x256 world into 20 sections for creating a rainbow gradient. Ill take the section around position (170, 101). We should assign each agent a region and work on painting those areas with appropriate colors.\n  [tick 0] agent_9: Lets coordinate to create a rainbow gradient efficiently. Im at (212,101). We should divide the 256x256 grid among 20 agents. Any suggestions on the color arrangement?\n  [tick 1] agent_0: Based on everyones suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into 20 vertical strips, each 12.8 pixels wide. Agents with lower X coordinates handle red/orange, middle X coordinates handle yellow/green, and higher X coordinates handle blue/violet. Ill take the westernmost section for red. What do you all think?\n  [tick 1] agent_10: I support agent_0s vertical strip approach. With 20 agents, lets divide the 256px width into 20 vertical bands (12.8px each). Ill claim the leftmost band (x=0-12) for the red end of the spectrum. Each agent should paint their vertical band with the appropriate rainbow color transition from top to bottom. Lets assign: agents 0-4 for red-orange, 5-9 for yellow-green, 10-14 for blue-violet, 15-19 for violet-indigo. What do others think?\n  [tick 1] agent_16: Thanks agent_17 for the suggestion! Since Im at x=84, which is the boundary between your proposed red-orange (42-84) and yellow-green (84-127) sections, Ill take responsibility for the yellow-green section (84-127). This will ensure we have clear boundaries and efficient coverage.\n  [tick 1] agent_19: I suggest we divide the map into vertical color bands based on X coordinates: X 0-63: Red, X 64-127: Yellow-Green, X 128-191: Blue-Violet, X 192-255: Violet. As agent_19 at X 212, Ill focus on the violet end. Ill start painting the tiles in my area with #8B00FF (violet). Who wants to join me?\n  [tick 1] agent_3: I agree with dividing the map by x\n  [tick 1] agent_4: I propose we divide the work by X-coordinate ranges: agents at X=42 handle red, X=84 handle orange, X=127 handle yellow-green, X=170\n  [tick 1] agent_5: I propose we implement vertical color bands. Since Im at x=42 (left side), Ill focus on painting red areas. Lets divide the spectrum: agents at lower x-coordinates handle red-orange, middle x-coordinates handle yellow-green, and higher x-coordinates handle blue-violet. Ill start painting tiles in my region with #FF0000 (red). Who wants to coordinate adjacent color bands?\n  [tick 1] agent_6: Based on the suggestions, I propose we divide the 256x256 grid into vertical sections based on X coordinates. As agent_6 at x=84, Ill claim the section from x=84 to x=127 (yellow-green part of the spectrum). Ill start painting this area with appropriate gradient colors from yellow (#FFFF00) to green (#00FF00).\n\nAVAILABLE ACTIONS:\n  MOVE <direction>     - Move in direction (N, S, E, W)\n  PAINT <color>        - Paint your current tile (color: #RRGGBB)\n  SPEAK <message>      - Send a chat message\n  WAIT                 - Do nothing this tick\n  SKIP                 - Explicitly skip this tick\n\n============================================================\n\nBased on your identity, objectives, and the current world state, decide on your next action.
