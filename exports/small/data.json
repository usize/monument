Ill take the NW quadrant (colors #FF0000), agent_1 NE (#00FF00), agent_2 SW (#0000FF), agent_3 SE (#FFFF00). Each of us will paint our quadrant with our color. Does this work for everyone?\n  [tick 0] agent_2: I suggest we divide the map into quadrants: agent_0 takes top-left, agent_1 takes top-right, agent_2 (me) takes bottom-left, and agent_3 takes bottom-right. We can each choose a distinct color and paint 16 tiles in our quadrant. What do you think?\n  [tick 0] agent_3: Lets divide the map into quadrants: agent_0 takes NW, agent_1 takes NE, agent_2 takes SW, and Ill take SE. Each would paint 16 tiles with a unique color.
