world:
  width: 64
  height: 64
  goal: "Create a beautiful sunset scene with orange and purple gradients"
  epoch: 100

agents:
  # Individual agent with explicit position and custom LLM
  - id: supervisor
    position: { x: 32, y: 32 }
    facing: N
    scopes: [MOVE, PAINT, SPEAK, WAIT, SKIP, SUPERVISOR]
    instructions: |
      You are the supervisor agent. Your role is to coordinate the worker agents
      to create a beautiful sunset scene. Direct them to paint specific areas
      with appropriate colors.
    # LLM settings (all optional - omit to use defaults)
    llm_model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
    llm_base_url: ""  # Empty uses default
    llm_api_key: ""   # Empty uses environment variable

  # Individual agent at center
  - id: coordinator
    position: center
    facing: S
    scopes: [SPEAK, WAIT, SKIP]
    instructions: |
      You are the coordinator. Help agents communicate effectively.

  # Individual agent with random position
  - id: scout
    position: random
    facing: E
    scopes: [MOVE, SPEAK, WAIT, SKIP]
    instructions: |
      You are a scout agent. Explore the world and report back.

  # Bulk agents with grid layout
  - prefix: worker
    count: 9
    layout: grid
    facing: N
    scopes: [MOVE, PAINT, SPEAK, WAIT, SKIP]
    instructions: |
      You are a worker agent. Paint tiles as directed by the supervisor.
      Focus on creating smooth color gradients.

  # Bulk agents with random layout
  - prefix: helper
    count: 3
    layout: random
    facing: W
    scopes: [MOVE, PAINT, WAIT, SKIP]
    instructions: |
      You are a helper agent. Assist other agents with painting tasks.
